        <h5>Most applications are approved instantly</h5>
        <p>An application will require review if:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Over 500 guests are expected to attend</li>
          <li>You have more than three permits in one month or over 24 per year</li>
          <li>You host an event that ends after 10 p.m. for outdoor events and 2 a.m. for indoor events</li>
          <li>You are charging over the cost recovery price for liquor</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Local police review some applications based on an event's size and whether late hours are being
          requested. These review requirements are specific to each police jurisdiction. If your application
          requires police and/or LCRB approval we suggest submitting your application at least 30 days before
          the event start date.
        </p>
        <p>
          At a minimum, all applications requiring approval must be submitted within 14 days of the start
          date. Applications submitted with less time may not be approved due to late notice.
