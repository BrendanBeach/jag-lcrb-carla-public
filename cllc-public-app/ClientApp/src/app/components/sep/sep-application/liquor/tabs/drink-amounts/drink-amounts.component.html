                The provincial sales tax (PST) on liquor products is 10%. You will have to prepay the PST upon your
                approved licence and then get reimbursed by collecting proceeds from drinks sold at your event. This tax
                is in addition to the licence fee. PST calculations are based on the number of servings rather than the
                amount of alcohol you will purchase.
            </p>
            <p>
                PST Refund: If you pay too much PST or if you make less money than expected, you can apply for a refund
                to the Ministry of Finance, free of charge.

                <span>How is PST Calculated</span><br>
                <span>
                    Example:You purchase a Special Event Permit and $500 in liquor for your wedding. You expect to
                    sell the liquor for $800 at the wedding. The PST you pay when you buy the liquor will be $50.00 and
                    the PST equivalent amount you pay when you purchase the permit will be $30.00, calculated as
                    follows:
                </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Your cost of the liquor purchased (10% PST on $500) = $50.00 Your expected tax on resale revenue (10%
                PST on $300) = $30.00 paid before you receive your permit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Total combined amount due = $80.00
            </p>
            <p>
